# AnaRchX-Addon
AnaRchX-Addons for BTW:CE

Adds a charcoal pit mechanic (sort of), where you can create Coal Cinder blocks by covering Smouldering Logs with solid blocks, effectively giving you coal as a result.
Also introduces Ash pile items when mining Coal Cinder Blocks.
  -Current functions include: Right click to place under you as an Ash ground tile, Inventory clutter. More uses will be introduced at a later date.
